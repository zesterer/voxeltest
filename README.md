# VoxelTest

A test voxel engine program

## What is VoxelTest?

VoxelTest is simply a test program I use when developing my voxel library, 'libvolume'.

Compile and run it if you so with, but it's not very interesting unless, like me, you have the strange sort of brain that feels satisfied when you see lots of text flying up the display of a terminal emulator.

## Compilation

~ From the root repository directory ~

`mkdir build`

`cd build`

`cmake ..`

`make`

## Running

~ Assuming you've run the compilation commands above ~

`./voxeltest`
